# Cplusplus-program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
The primary goal of this project was to show competency in combining languages. The project itself intakes a list of items and retuns the count for each items numerically and visually through a histogram. It is designed to help a store gain data on their daily sales of each product. This project uses both C++ and Python to demenstrate the individual strengths of each language and how combining them can be a powerful tool for a software engineer. 

# What did you do particularly well?:
My project demonstrates an efficient code with a visually appealing output. It utilizes built in methods for both python C++ that streamline the code making it both managable and easy to read. It validates user input when selecting menue options are returnes error messages when recieving incorrect input. Using a switch in C++ eliminated excess lines of code. Taking advantage of pythons count method and ability to easily switch between a list and a set simplified the process each function needed to perform.  

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
We were provided with a starter code in which I did not use all of the provided function calls. I debated on deleting out the excess lines of code I did not need for this project to make my code more efficient but also recognized the value of leaving it in should the client request the program have new functions added in the future. After submission, I did realize that this project was for the same company as a previous project and I should have gone through their previously provided standards document to make sure my code met their companies specific style requirements. As this project has yet to be graded, I don't have feedback to work with for further enhancment.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the most challenging part of this project to be eliminating duplicate data in the output. It took some research to learn about sets but I was able to find the needed information through websites such as StackOverflow and GeeksForGeeks. Other challenges included formatting my output for the histogram to make it more visually appealing but that only required going back into the readings for previous courses. Thankfully the rest of the code I was able to create without too much dificulty by going back through my own previous work to remeber python methods for breaking appart strings and couting words. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
An important skill that I gained from this project would be knowing when to combine languages and the benefits each have to offer. This project boosted my confidence to be able to work in different languages and return to ones I hadn't looked at in a while. It also helped me gain a better understanding on how to read and write files, a concept I knew about but has very little practice implimenting.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In-line commenting makes this code easy to follow/read. All of the variables are given discriptive names to help one looking at the project follow along. Adding more user options is as simple as adding a new case into the switch. The formatting is built into the functions so the user won't have to worry about adjusting it. The imoprt and export files are located in the project file so this prjoect could easily be copied onto any computer without losing it's file paths.
